In SQL, a common but subtle error is using the wrong join type. For example, using a LEFT JOIN when you need an INNER JOIN can lead to unexpected results. The LEFT JOIN will include all rows from the left table, even if there is no match in the right table, while an INNER JOIN will only return rows where there's a match in both tables.  Another common error is failing to handle NULL values appropriately.  Comparisons involving NULL values can behave differently than you might expect.
